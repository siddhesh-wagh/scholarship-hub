# ScholarshipHub - MahaDBT Portal Information Platform

**ScholarshipHub** is a web platform designed to simplify the scholarship application journey for students in Maharashtra. Created as a college project, this frontend interface provides essential information on the **MahaDBT (Maharashtra Direct Benefit Transfer) Portal** and helps eligible students navigate through various government scholarship schemes, including **Pre-Matric** and **Post-Matric** scholarships.
