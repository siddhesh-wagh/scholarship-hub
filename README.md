# ScholarshipHub - MahaDBT Portal Information Platform

**ScholarshipHub** is a dedicated platform created to simplify the scholarship application journey for students in Maharashtra. Built as a part of a college project, this frontend interface provides streamlined access to crucial information on the **MahaDBT (Maharashtra Direct Benefit Transfer) Portal**. Through this platform, students can learn about available scholarships, eligibility criteria, and the necessary steps to apply, helping them make the most of government-sponsored educational support.

This project aims to bridge the gap between students and complex government processes, making it easier for students to navigate and access the support they need.
